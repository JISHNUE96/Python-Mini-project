# Python-Mini-project
Python Mini project (Mini Project-Calculator Application, EDA - Fifa Players Dataset )
"Developed a command-line Calculator Application, implementing core Python functions for arithmetic operations with a focus on input validation and modular code design. Additionally, completed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the FIFA Players Dataset, using Python libraries to analyze player statistics, identify trends, and visualize key insights. These projects enhanced my skills in practical coding, data handling, and analytical visualization."
